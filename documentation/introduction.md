### Vision

Nouns Game Engine is a CC0 general-purpose game engine. It has two primary reasons to exist:

* Be a public good for game development in the form of a hyperstructure
* Be an infinite source of Nouns meme proliferation through composable, distributable, cross-platform Nounish game experiences
