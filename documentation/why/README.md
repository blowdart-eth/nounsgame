# Why?

### Background

Many of today's modern [game ](https://www.unrealengine.com/)[engines ](https://unity.com/)are permissioned, licensed-not-owned, centralized, and take a sliding fee or yearly subscription fees from developers to use.

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), the world's largest PC gaming platform, [banned games](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/steam-quietly-bans-games-feature-crypto-nft-exchanges/) that incorporate NFTs.

[NFT Worlds](https://www.nftworlds.com/) started a successful project before [Microsoft banned the use of Minecraft](https://www.pcgamer.com/after-minecraft-says-no-to-nfts-nft-worlds-vows-to-make-its-own-game/) servers for games like theirs.

_We can do better._

[Ethereum ](https://ethereum.org/)unlocks immutable, irrevocable, "unstoppable" gaming paradigms. [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf) is a pioneer of funding public goods.

Nouns Game Engine is a project to combine these two forces into a project that unlocks a better model for everyone, while providing fully-editable, [_Nounish_](https://twitter.com/nounish) example games that help proliferate the meme, on an Ethereum-native infrastructure that is free for everyone to play, create, and profit from.

### A personal reason

> "I want a game engine that's suitable for me to use, but that works at a higher level when I'm making games with my daughter.
>
> With my daughter, the learning and frustration curve on development platforms like [Roblox Studio](https://web.roblox.com/create) is too high, but the flexibility and creative potential of [Mario Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super\_Mario\_Maker) is too low. When I'm making games for myself, I want a powerful, intuitive system that truly belongs to me."\
