# The Content Problem

On a space-constrained ledger, user-generated content is expensive to store, and for more ambitious projects, impossible, when those assets are high resolution graphic textures, soundtracks, and cutscene video.

NounsGame can mitigate these concerns by supporting a variety of game-addressable assets.

| Layer 1 Ethereum Assets            | The most resilient way to store assets is always to store them on-chain, and to collaborate with others to maximize the amount of game assets available for everyone to use.                                                                                                                   |
| Procedural Public Goods            | By providing on-chain tools for procedurally generating content, such as sounds and textures, users only need to store the "seed" number that correspond to their asset, and an optional identifying name, to create content. Other creators can contribute their own procedural public goods. |
| Decentralized Storage Alternatives | Users can store their larger assets on [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary\_File\_System), or [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), so only the location of those assets needs to be saved in their game content manifest.                                                      |
