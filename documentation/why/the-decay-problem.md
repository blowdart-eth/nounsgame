# The Decay Problem

#### Games decay, and need constant updates. NGE needs to be unstoppable. How is this achieved?

By hosting core functionality, such as graphics, physics, discovery, and user-generated content facilities on-chain, these components will act as strict specifications that the NGE client, or other game clients using the underlying systems, should follow. So while the client will change, how the client draws graphics, or simulates physics, for example, will not.
