# FAQ & FUD

### FAQ

Feel free to [ask us anything](https://twitter.com/NounsGameWTF). We'll post answers here.

### FUD

Addressing reality-checks for the project.

#### [Godot ](https://godotengine.org/)is [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) licensed, open-source, and free, why not use that?

#### Ethereum and the EVM are too slow to run games in real-time!

#### Without liquidity or financial incentives, the project will die after completion

#### How do we know the team has the ability to ship this?

#### Why not just use Unity or Unreal?

#### You'll never catch up to Unity or Unreal, they represent uncountable years of engineering effort!

#### Why [NounsDAO ](https://nouns.wtf/)and not venture capital?

#### Why not just build a game? Making an engine versus a game is backwards!

#### Why is there no token or governance for the project?
