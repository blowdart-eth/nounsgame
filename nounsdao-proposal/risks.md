# Risks

#### Game development is hard, and projects frequently ship late

While development is hard at any level, we have built custom engines and delivered games before, and hope to leverage our experience to predict challenges, estimate and scope work more accurately, and pivot earlier in cases where design falls short.

We can stay ahead of these realities by providing frequent updates on progress and setbacks through weekly posts to the project hub.

#### Key talent is unavailable

While we have key personnel in mind with a track record of both delivering successfully and working together, it's possible that we cannot engage them due to availability or interest. Alternate resources would have to be carefully vetted.
