# Risks

#### Game development is hard and projects frequently ship late

#### [Godot ](https://godotengine.org/)is [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) licensed, open-source, and free, why not use that?

#### Ethereum and the EVM are too slow to run games in real-time!

#### Without liquidity or financial incentives, the project will die after completion

#### How do we know the team has the ability to ship this?

#### Why not just use Unity or Unreal?

#### Why [NounsDAO ](https://nouns.wtf/)and not Venture Capital?

#### Why not just build a game? Making an engine versus a game is backwards!
