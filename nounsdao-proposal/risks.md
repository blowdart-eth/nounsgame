# Risks

#### Game development is hard and projects frequently ship late

#### Without liquidity or financial incentives, the project will die after completion

#### How do we know the team has the ability to ship this?

#### Why not just use Unity or Unreal?

#### Why NounsDAO and not Venture Capital?

#### Why not just build a game? Making an engine versus a game is backwards!
