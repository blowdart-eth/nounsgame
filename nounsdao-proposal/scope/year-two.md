# Year Two

In our second year, we refine the offering, add an additional, popular engine and example, and solidify the runtime for wide public use.

### Game Delivery

To showcase the engine features, deliver on meme proliferation, and provide well-architected examples for further modification, we will ship an additional game. This year also gives us the opportunity to iterate on existing work, produce documentation, fix bugs, and collect feedback on usability.

#### Voxel Sandbox Game

A voxel game demonstrating the 3D voxel-based engine.

### Component/Feature Delivery

Success of the project depends on these component deliverables, the absence of which blocks use of the engine as a public good for the additional features cited below.

* **Engine Modes**
  * Pixel 3D voxel-based engine w/ 3D physics
* **Camera Subsystem**
  * 3D first-person camera
* **In-Game Editor (**[**IMGUI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate\_mode\_GUI)**-based)**
  * Lighting support
* **Runtime Subsystem**
  * World/Map [Streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming\_media)
* **Networking Subsystem**
  * Basic client/server packet-based protocol
