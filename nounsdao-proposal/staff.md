# Staff

## Development Team

{% hint style="info" %}
These roles can cross multiple people, depending on the project plan.
{% endhint %}

#### Lead Hyperstructure Developer (full-time)

This role is to map out all interaction points between the core engine and the blockchain hyperstructure, develop bridges between EVM and C#, and replace, wherever possible existing C# capabilities with EVM native capabilities, using the C# implementation as a test harness for verifying correct behavior. Much of the feedback loop in this role is also building the sample/default games using the engine and ensuring their suitability for hyperstructure hosting.

#### Lead Engine Design (full-time)

This role is to solidify the game engine design providing core functionality for all sub-systems. This role is C# focused, employing immediate-mode integrated tooling and data-driven design principles, though the developer is expected to adopt, assimilate, and integrate blockchain native concepts and approach design in a way that all components and interoperable and replaceable with EVM equivalents.

#### Game Tester / Technical Writer (variable)

While much of the project is engine-based and tested with simulation and automated testing techniques at scale, there is the potential need for a game tester to work with the development team to improve the quality and meme potential of the sample games, which are simple, but important starting points to demonstrate all aspects of creating, and distributing games on the hyperstructure to players. This includes documenting, through our documentation portal, social media posts, Discord playthroughs, the example games, editing process, and distribution process for players and builders.

#### Nounish Pixel Artist (contract, as needed)

This role is to assist with the creation of CC0 game and UI assets that are incorporated into the sample/default games are used as a springboard for users to branch from with their own creations. Unlike a commercial engine, the intent is to provide Nounish assets that are re-usable in any Nounish game in a permissionless way.

#### Nounish Voxel/3D Artist (contract, as needed)

This role is to assist with the creation of CC0 game and UI assets that demonstrate 3D capabilities of the engine. While core Nounish assets are likely to be algorithmically generated based on existing 2D assets, some custom assets are necessary to provide a more complete experience in the sample games.

#### Sound Designer (contract, as needed)

This role is to assist with the creation of and/or sourcing and mixing of CCO music and sound effect assets that demonstrate the audio capabilities of the engine, and augment the sample/default games.
