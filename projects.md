| evm-gpu                                                   | A collection of GPU-based EVM execution libraries, ranging from adapters on known graphics and physics method signatures, to alternative execution engines for EVM bytecode.                                                                                | Necessary for reaching consumer scale for [NounsGame ](https://github.com/wattsyart/nounsgame)[hyperstructures](<README (1).md>), so that they remain addressable from Ethereum nodes.                                                                                   |
| kohi-lang                                                 | An intermediate language for general-purpose graphics composition.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Necessary for minimizing the storage requirements for on-chain runtime graphics, namely, procedural, generative, and shader-based works.                                                                                                                                 |
| [kohi-composer](https://github.com/kohiart/kohi-composer) | An EVM-native software rasterizer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Necessary for interpreting kohi-lang opcodes and scheduling them for EVM execution. Acts as a bridge between available graphics hyperstructures, and the intended output.                                                                                                |
| kohi-santoku                                              | A C# to Solidity transpiler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | As C# is the common language used in Unity development and countless indie games, creating a  bridge between C# and Solidity is path to onboarding more game developers as well as allows us better facility to test code destined for the EVM that will run game logic. |
